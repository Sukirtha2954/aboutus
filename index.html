    <p>We help you in tough times like the Pandemic to find good doctors who can look after your casual health checkup and other minor medical requirements.
        From the start of this pandemic we can see how the big hospitals are working from day to night treating patients who are suffering from the virus outbreak. The elderly and the children have to unnecessarily go to these big hospitals and wait about  2-3 hours per day just to have a regular checkup.
        It also affects both the doctor and the patients who can easily contract the virus.
